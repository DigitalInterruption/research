Frida is a framework which allows us to inject JavaScript into running applications. This has made reverse engineering and modifying applications easier than ever. Although Frida has a large following amongst mobile application testers, Frida also supports desktop applications and with not much effort, it is possible to profile, debug and patch code. This talk will go though the basics of Frida, showing how it can be used to understand logic, dump secrets, and bypass security controls. We'll look at using Frida to attack Linux and Android applications.
