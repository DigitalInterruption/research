Frida feels almost magic in how it can inject JavaScript into running applications. This has made reverse engineering and modifying applications - especially on mobile devices where many security controls are embedded in the client, significantly easier.

This workshop goes though the basics of Frida and though exercises and walkthroughs showing how Frida can be used to rapidly reverse engineer applications to understand logic flow, dump secrets and bypass security controls.

The exercises are written to run on Linux with a final demonstration on bypassing a security control on an Android application. Exercise can be found [https://github.com/DigitalInterruption/FridaWorkshop](https://github.com/DigitalInterruption/FridaWorkshop).
