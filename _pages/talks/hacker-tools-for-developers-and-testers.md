Presented at SecureGuild 2019.

There are so many awesome hacker tools for hackers out there - things like nmap, nessus and even zap proxy. They work great if you're a pen tester but trying to use these tools in a way that makes sense for development and testing teams can be challenging. In this session, we'll look at how we can use Frida, a tool used by pen testers, to add in security test cases into our Android applications so they are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
