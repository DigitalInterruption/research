This talk looks at the security issues associated with the type of low power wireless network technology frequently used in Internet of Things products. I describe the way in which software defined radio can be used to analyse and exploit weaknesses in radio products that make no attempt to protect the over the air data.

The talk demos reverse engineering a wireless door bell using SDR and performing replay attacks with a HackRF and a YARD Stick one.
